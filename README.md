# CornellProjects
This repository holds writen course projects that were developed during a 6 month cybersecurity course I took at the online at Cornel University, Ithaca, USA.

# First Project: Systems Security
There are five parts to this project.
1. Part one is to choose a system from a set of four possible categories. I chose electronic voting systems
2. Part two is to identify threats of concern to electronic voting systems.
3. Part three is to come up with a set of security goals for the system
4. Part four considers how the security goals might be enforced.
5. Part five examines how the system could have an effect o existing laws or social values.

# Second Project: Authenticating Machines
1. Part one, identifies how shared key cryptography could be used to secure the system in the **first project**. 
2. Part two, identifies which machines need to be authenticated and design an authentication scheme for the system. 
3. Part three identifies where public key encryption could be used to secure the system. The authentication scheme is revised to include public key components where appropriate. 

# Third Project: Authenticating Humans
1. Part one identifies the human principals that need to be authenticated and how to do 
the authentication with passwords. 
2. Part two decides which humans should be authenticated with physical tokens and how 
to do that.
3. Part three identifies which humans should be authenticated with biometrics and how to 
do that.

# Fourth Project: Discretionary Access Control
1. Part one defines an authorization relation the system.
2. Part two identifies which parts of your authorization relation can be implemented with capabilities and design a capability scheme for the system.
3. Part three designs the remaining enforcement mechanisms for other authorization relation.

# Fifth Project: Mandatory Access Control
1. Part one identifies which parts of the authorization relation can be implemented with multi-level security. The  authorization mechanisms is then revised for these components.
2. In Part two idetifies which parts of the authorization relation can be implemented with commercial security policies or role-based access control. The  authorization mechanisms is then revised for these components. 
3. Part three identifies which parts of the authorization relation can be implemented with credentials-based authorization. Credentials and guards are then designed for the voting system.

# Sixth: Enforcement Mechanisms
1. Part one identifies which of the enforcement mechanisms designed previously are examples of monitoring.
2. Part two identifies which of the enforcement mechanisms designed previously are examples of re-writing. 
3. Part Three identifies which of the enforcement mechanisms designed previously are examples of isolation.
